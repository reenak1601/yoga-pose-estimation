                <p>Moutain pose is a pose where one stands firm and erect as an unshakeable mountain.
                    It’s the mother of all asanas since many poses emerge from this Pose. 
                   Mountain Pose is considered as a foundational standing pose for any other yoga pose (asana).
                    Mastery over this asana with the firmness of the feet, toes, and shoulders, and chest will benefit in the practice of all other yoga poses. 
                   It’s a neutral, transitional pose between two standing poses.
                    At a deeper practice, it helps in observing the body in stillness and still having awareness of the body alignment.
                    The seven chakras are balanced in this pose, and also energizes and keeps the body-mind calm.
                    When done with intention, Mountain Pose helps you find the strength and stability of a mountain inside yourself and helps you to embody those qualities.

            <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 offset-sm-1 text-center">
                <p>This posture replicates the graceful, steady stance of a tree.
                    Unlike most yoga poses, the Tree Pose requires keeping our eyes open in order to maintain body balance.
                   Tree Pose is a strengthening posture that can help build confidence.
                    This pose can improve your posture and counteract the effects of prolonged sitting. 
                   On your standing leg, this pose strengthens your thigh, buttock (glute), and ankle.
                    On your lifted leg, this pose gently stretches your entire thigh and buttocks.

            </div>
            <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 text-center">
                <p>Downward Dog Pose is a foundational yoga posture Because this pose is equal parts strengthening and stretching,
                    practicing Down Dog can help to build better balance and flexibility throughout your whole body. 
                    Just be sure to practice it with care and attention: If you have stiff shoulders or hamstrings, the pose may feel challenging.
                     If you’re flexible, you want to be cautious to avoid collapsing in your lower back and shoulders.
                    Downward-Facing Dog Pose can help you recover after sports and activities like running. 
                    It improves posture, circulation, and counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting.

            <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 offset-sm-1 text-center">
                <p>Virabhadrasana 1 may be one of the more common yoga poses.
                    It may also be one of the most challenging.
                    Warrior 1 Pose requires you to push past your perceived physical, mental, and emotional limitations to move into a deeper expression of the asana. 
                   It’s an opportunity to focus and practice determination.
                   Warrior 1 Pose is filled with opposing alignments, but when all of the opposing movements work together, the pose offers a full-body experience.
                    You will stretch the ankles and calves, strengthen the quadriceps and back, lengthen the psoas, and stretch your upper body and arms.
                    There’s almost no body part that doesn’t reap the rewards of holding warrior 1. </p>

                <p>This pose is considered as a difficult pose as the body alignment needs to be accurate, but is generally categorized as an Intermediate Level Pose or Beginner Level Pose. 
                    Its is said that the power of this pose can be felt only if one is extremely flexible and stable with their body balance.
                    When you stay in the pose for any length of time, you strengthen your resolve and focus.
                     Remain internally focused on your physical and mental sensations.
                     Become aware of any discomfort and discern whether your desire to straighten your leg and release your arms comes from a physical need or a psychological want. 
                    Always act according to your need in the moment. This discernment is the discipline and strength of a true warrior.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 offset-sm-1 text-center">
            <p>Chair Pose is sometimes translated from Sanskrit to English as “Fierce Seat” or “Powerful Pose.”
                It is a strengthening and heat-building asana that brings all parts of your body together into a cohesive and powerful whole.
               
               This pose is a meditation on determination and perseverance, as well as commitment.
                To successfully perform Chair Pose, you must seamlessly unite the strength of the legs, arms, and torso as you lift your core muscles and lengthen your spine.
               Chair Pose demands strength and stamina in the body, but also focus in the breath and mind.
                When you are centered and aligned in the posture, you’ll feel like you’re accessing a great well of energy. 
               Chair Pose offers a powerful lesson and a key concept in yoga: Steady practice over time is better than occasional, intense spurts.
                Consistency in yoga, and in Utkatasana, yields deep and lasting results.</p>
